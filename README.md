# Jobly Client

## What is This?
This repo represents the front-end client for a bootcamp development project focused on learning React. The app interacts with an Express backend and provides an authenticated job posting / browsing experience. It was developed as part of my Full-Stack Software Engineering curriculum at the Rithm School bootcamp in partnership with a fellow cohort member.

- How to handle exceptions and pass exception message downstream via callbacks

## How to Run
- Run `npm install` to install pre-requisites
- Run `npm start` to start the React app
- Install and run the Express backend
